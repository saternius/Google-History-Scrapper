# Google-History-Scrapper
Uses casperjs to conveniently store all your google search queries into a easy to read txt file.(Because for some reason google doesn't provide the ability to do that easily). 
    <p>To run you must have casperjs installed</p>
    <p> edit scrape.js so that username = "your user name" and password = "your acc password"
    <p>after that just run "casperjs scrape.js" in the directory of scrape.js</p>
